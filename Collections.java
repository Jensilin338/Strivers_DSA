/*
Arrays: *We can store multiple values of same-type.
  Limitations: The size of array is fixed once created.
               If we need to store more elements that array's capacity we are stuck.
               May have to create new array, copy old elements then add new ones -a tedious process-
               There are no built-in methods for operN like searching,
               sorting or removing elements.

----Then comes JCF---
JAVA Collections framework(JCF)
    List : ordered collections that can have duplicate elements.
    Set : unordered collections that do not allow duplicates.
    Queue : collections designed to hold elements before processing.
